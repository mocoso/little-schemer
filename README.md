# Little Schemer book club

In which we write a ruby interpreter for scheme and use it to work
through the [Little Schemer
book](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/).

Join the [Understanding Computation mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/computationbook) if you want to
be involved in discussions about the book club.
