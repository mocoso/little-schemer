# Little Schemer book club

In which we write a ruby interpreter for scheme and use it to work
through the [Little Schemer
book](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/).

Join the [Understanding Computation mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/computationbook) if you want to
be involved in discussions about the book club.

## Meetings

It's an open invite so anyone is welcome to attend, just tell us you are coming
by marking yourself as attending on Lanyrd (see links below).

They will be every third Monday except when this clashes with LRUG or is
otherwise inconvenient for us.
